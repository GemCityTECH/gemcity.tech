In 2022 we added the **Frameworks**, **Code For Dayton** and **Gem City ML / AI** user groups to the family of user groups. Unfortunatley the **Frameworks** would drop off the roster in 2023.

The **New to Web** group migrated to **New to Tech** with it's new leadership under Matt Alioto.

Our family of user groups (in order of monthly occurance) for the 2022 season:
