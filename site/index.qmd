## What's changing in 2024?

- The Dayton Web Developers users groups have joined to focus on the broader topics related to software engineering, application development, web development and mobile development.  

  We will still meet on the same nights (the 1st Wednesday and the 2nd Thursday) but both we will not stay in the borders of web or .NET topics for either night.  

  This new structure will be organized by Hanen Alkhafaji, James, Carr &amp; Allen May

- **Cognitive Think Tank** has joined the GemCity TECH family and will be meeting the 2nd Wednesday of the month online only. Welcome to the leadership team Layla Akilan &amp; Damon Troncone.

All user groups are free and open to the public.
